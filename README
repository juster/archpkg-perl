* PERL PKGBUILD

Here is a repo to generate, and hopefully later, test the perl 5.12
package for Archlinux.

Right now there is not much to it.  Just run "make.pl" to generate a
PKGBUILD, clean old package directories, and build a new package.

** TODO
*** Figure out a way to install into a sandbox.
    I would rather not break my system to see if the PKGBUILD "works".
*** Create some automated tests to test the core perl packages

** File List
|------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Filename         | Purpose                                           |
|------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| dump_provides.pl | Tests the PerlProvides.pm module.                 |
| make.pl          | Clean the build process, then make package.       |
| perlbin.sh       | The unchanged perlbin.sh.                         |
| PerlProvides.pm  | Module for generating PKGBUILD provides.          |
| PKGBUILD.tt      | The PKGBUILD template (its only var is provides). |
| PKGBUILD         | The generated PKGBUILD.                           |

*** PerlProvides.pm
    PerlProvides.pm is not perfect.  Right now we lookup modules on CPAN,
    using CPANPLUS.  However, this is looking up the latest module
    versions.  I haven't yet figured out how to only lookup the module
    versions specified by Module::CoreList.

*** perl.install
    I removed the perl.install file.  Why are we deleting files?
    Shouldn't we be removing packages instead?  What if those files
    belong to packages?
